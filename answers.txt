Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a great tool for developers who work in teams on larger projects. By using Git, you can easily keep track of you and your groupmates progress. Additionally, it allows you and your groupmates to work asynchronously on multiple files; This is perfect for large projects with massive codebases and with many developers. It provides an easy way to revisit and return to older code, making it very useful for backing up personal projects.
