Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a great tool for developers who work in teams on larger projects. By using Git, you can easily keep track of you and your groupmates progress. Additionally, it allows you and your groupmates to work asynchronously on multiple files; This is perfect for large projects with massive codebases and with many developers. It provides an easy way to revisit and return to older code, making it very useful for backing up personal projects.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to any field with quantifiable data that needs to be measured, stored, and analyzed. A good example of this would be the field of chemistry. After an experiment (or multiple experiments), data science can be used to store experiment (via Pandas, SQL, or even an Excel sheet), display experiment data in a digestable way, and form conclusions after analysis of the data.
